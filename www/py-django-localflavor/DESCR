django-localflavor is a collection of assorted pieces of code that are
useful for particular countries or cultures. These are called the "local
flavor" add-ons and live in the localflavor package.

Inside that package, country- or culture-specific code is organized into
subpackages, named using ISO 3166 country codes.

Most of the localflavor add-ons are localized form components deriving
from the forms framework - for example, a USStateField that knows how to
validate U.S. state abbreviations, and a FISocialSecurityNumber that
knows how to validate Finnish social security numbers.
