telepath is a Django library for exchanging data between Python and
JavaScript, allowing you to build apps with rich client-side interfaces
while keeping the business logic in server-side code.

It provides a mechanism for packing structured data, including Python
objects, into a JSON-serializable format. This mechanism can be extended
to support any Python class, by registering the class with a
corresponding JavaScript implementation. The packed data can then be
included in an HTTP response, and unpacked in JavaScript to obtain an
equivalent data structure to the original. Think of it as pickle, but
with the unpickling happening in the browser.
