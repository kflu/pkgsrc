This module is the gateway to the various OAuth2 grant flows, as
documented at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749. Each module
implements a specific grant flow and is designed to "just work"
with minimal detail and effort.

Please see Net::OAuth2::AuthorizationServer::Manual for more
information on how to use this module and the various grant types.
You should use the manual in conjunction with the grant type module
you are using to understand how to override the defaults if the
"just work" mode isn't good enough for you.
