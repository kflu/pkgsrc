JSON Web Token is described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519.
Mojo::JWT implements that standard with an API that should feel
familiar to Mojolicious users (though of course it is useful
elsewhere). Indeed, JWT is much like Mojolicious::Sessions except
that the result is a url-safe text string rather than a cookie.

In JWT, the primary payload is called the claims, and a few claims
are reserved, as seen in the IETF document. The header and the
claims are signed when stringified to guard against tampering. Note
that while signed, the data is not encrypted, so don't use it to
send secrets over clear channels.
