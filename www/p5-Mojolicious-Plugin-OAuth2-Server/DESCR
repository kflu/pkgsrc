This plugin implements the various OAuth2 grant types flow as
described at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749. It is a complete
implementation of RFC6749, with the exception of the "Extension
Grants" as the description of that grant type is rather hand-wavy.

The bulk of the functionality is implemented in the
Net::OAuth2::AuthorizationServer distribution, you should see that
for more comprehensive documentation and examples of usage.

The examples here use the "Authorization Code Grant" flow as that
is considered the most secure and most complete form of OAuth2.
