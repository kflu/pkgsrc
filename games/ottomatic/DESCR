This is Pangea Software's Otto Matic updated to run on modern desktop
platforms.

The year is 1957 and a fleet of flying saucers from Planet X have come to
Earth. These saucers are under the control of the evil Brain Aliens who are
abducting helpless human beings to become slaves of The Giant Brain.

You are Otto Matic, the robot who is given the job of saving Earth from the
clutches of The Giant Brain from Planet X. You must rescue as many humans as
you can while defeating the Brain Aliens and all of their evil followers.
Your mission will take you to strange and fantastic alien worlds which are
often treacherous and will require Otto to perform amazing feats.
