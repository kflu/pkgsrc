Nanosaur II: Hatchling is a continuation of the original Nanosaur storyline,
only this time you get to fly a pterodactyl who's loaded with hi-tech
weaponry. In addition to the three level adventure mode where you blast
enemy dinos and save eggs, there are also six two-player levels including
racing, capture-the-flag, and battle.

This is a port of the original Mac version of the game to modern operating
systems, made under permission from Pangea Software, Inc.
