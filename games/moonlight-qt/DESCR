Moonlight is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream protocol,
which is the protocol used by the NVIDIA Shield. 

You can stream your collection of PC games from your GameStream-compatible
PC to any supported device and play them remotely. Moonlight is perfect for
gaming on the go without sacrificing the graphics and game selection
available on PC.
