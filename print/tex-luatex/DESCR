LuaTeX is a greatly extended version of pdfTeX using Lua as an
embedded scripting language. The LuaTeX project's main
objective is to provide an open and configurable variant of TeX
while at the same time offering substantive backward
compatibility. LuaTeX uses Unicode (as UTF-8) as its default
input encoding, and is able to use modern (OpenType and
TrueType) fonts (for both text and mathematics).
