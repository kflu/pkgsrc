The Libertinus Fonts project includes four main type families:

- The Libertinus Serif family:

  6 serif typefaces cover three weights (Regular, Semibold, Bold) in each
  of two styles (Regular, Italic); originally forked from Linux
  Libertine.

- The Libertinus Sans family:

  3 sans-serif typefaces cover Regular, a Bold weight, and an Italic
  style; originally forked from Linux Biolinum.

- The Libertinus Mono family:

  1 monospace typeface derived from the serif family; originally forked
  from Linux Libertine Mono.

- The Libertinus Math family:

  1 OpenType math typeface derived from the serif family with many extra
  glyphs and features for use in OpenType math-capable applications (such
  as LuaTeX, XeTeX, or MS Word 2007+).

Additionally included are 3 special-use families with a single typeface
each:

- Libertinus Serif Display: A derivative of Libertinus Serif Regular
  optimized for display at large sizes.

- Libertinus Serif Initials: A derivative of Libertinus Serif with
  outlined variants of capital letter glyphs suitable for drop-caps or
  other decorations.

- Libertinus Keyboard: A derivative of Libertinus Sans with keyboard key
  outlines around each character suitable for use in technical
  documentation.
