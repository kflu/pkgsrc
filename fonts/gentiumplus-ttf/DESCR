Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface
family  designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the
world who use  the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality
publications. The  design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably
compact, and visually  attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of
Excellence in Typeface  Design" in two major international typeface
design competitions:  bukva:raz! (2001), TDC2003 (2003). The Gentium Plus
font family is based on this original design.

This project is intended to provide a free and open font family for all
current languages and writing systems that use Latin and Cyrillic
scripts. It supports almost the complete range of Unicode characters for
these scripts, including a comprehensive range of diacritics and a large
set of symbols useful for linguistics and literacy work. Smart font
routines automatically adjust the position of diacritics to support and
optimize arbitrary base+diacritic combinations.
