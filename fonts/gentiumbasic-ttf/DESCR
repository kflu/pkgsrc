Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use the
Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design is
intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually attractive.
Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design" in two major
international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001), TDC2003 (2003).

The Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic font families are based on the
original design, but with additional weights. The "Book" family is
slightly heavier. Both families come with a complete regular, bold,
italic and bold italic set of fonts.
