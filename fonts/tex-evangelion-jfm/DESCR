This package provides a Japanese Font Metric supporting
vertical and horizontal typesetting, 'linegap punctuations',
'extended fonts', and more interesting and helpful features
using traditional and simplified Chinese or Japanese fonts
under LuaTeX-ja. It also makes full use of the 'priority'
feature, meeting the standards, and allows easy customisation.
