Tagaini Jisho is a Japanese learning assistant built around a
vocabulary and kanji dictionary. Its goal is to make it easy to:

* Lookup and find words or kanji (later referred to as "entries")
  that you want to study,
* Mark and organize the entries you want to study or remember, and
* Consolidate your global knowledge by connecting related studied
  entries together to facilitate memorization.

Using Tagaini, you can add entries to your study list, tag them,
add notes, practice them as flashcards, and easily navigate to
related entries. A powerful search engine lets you look words and
kanji up from fragments of information, like character components
or number of strokes. Finally, export options allow you to print
booklets for study or export entries to CSV for e.g. using them...
