Alpine is the replacement for the Pine email and news client.

Alpine is a screen-oriented message-handling tool. In its default
configuration, Alpine offers an intentionally limited set of
functions geared toward the novice user, but it also has a large
list of optional "power-user" and personal-preference features.

This package also includes:
* pico(1), a simple text editor with limited searching,
  block cut and paste, and spell checking features.
* pilot(1), a simple, console-based,
  display-oriented file system navigator. Pilot provides basic file
  manipulation commands.
