marswm aims to be the rusty successor to moonwm. In addition to the window
manager this repository also contains the library it is built on,
an accompanying status bar and an ipc client to control the window manager
from external scripts.

marswm's goal is to have a simple tiling window manager with tiling and
workspaces.

Features:
 - dwm-style layouts
 - workspaces (like i3 - unlike dwm)
 - IPC using X11 atoms (mars-relay)
 - YAML for configuration and key bindings

The window manager supports multi-monitor setups, although they are not as well
tested as they probably should be for daily usage.
Every (non-overlapping) monitor gets its own set of workspaces, which is also
exposed as such to other applications like status bars. You can configure the
number of the primary monitor and secondary monitors with the primary_workspaces
and the secondary_workspaces option respectively.

It is suggested to use a relatively low number of workspaces for secondary
monitors as they might clutter your bar otherwise.
