AnyAscii provides ASCII-only replacement strings for practically all
Unicode characters. Text is converted character-by-character without
considering the context. The mappings for each script are based on
popular existing romanization systems. Symbolic characters are converted
based on their meaning or appearance. All ASCII characters in the input
are left unchanged, every other character is replaced with printable
ASCII characters. Unknown characters and some known characters are
replaced with an empty string and removed.
