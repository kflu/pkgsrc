his module makes syntax support for try/catch control flow easily
available.

Perl added such syntax at version 5.34.0, and extended it to support
optional finally blocks at 5.35.9, which is enabled by

   use feature 'try';

On that version of perl or later, this module simply enables the
core feature equivalent to using it directly. On such perls, this
module will install with no non-core dependencies, and requires no
C compiler.
