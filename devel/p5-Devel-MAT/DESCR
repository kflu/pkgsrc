The Devel::MAT ecosystem allows developers of perl programs to
inspect and analyse memory-related problems such as memory leaks,
unexpected memory consumption, or odd state. This is an "offline"
analysis system, in the sense that the analysis tools all run in
a different process, possibly at a later time, than the perl process
that is being analysed.
