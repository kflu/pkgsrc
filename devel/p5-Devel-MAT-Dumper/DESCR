This module provides the memory-dumping function that creates a
heap dump file which can later be read by Devel::MAT::Dumpfile. It
provides a single function which is not exported, which writes a
file to the given path.

The dump file will contain a representation of every SV in Perl's
arena, providing information about pointers between them, as well
as other information about the state of the process at the time it
was created. It contains a snapshot of the process at that moment
in time, which can later be loaded and analysed by various tools
using Devel::MAT::Dumpfile.
