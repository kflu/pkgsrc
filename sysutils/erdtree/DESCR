A modern, vibrant, and multi-threaded file-tree visualizer and disk usage
analyzer that respects hidden files and .gitignore rules by default, i.e.
the secret love child of tree and du.

erdtree is a modern alternative to tree and du in that it:
  - offers a minimal and user-friendly CLI
  - respects hidden files and .gitignore rules by default
  - displays file sizes in human-readable format by default
  - leverages parallism to traverse the file-system
  - displays files using ANSI colors by default
  - supports icons! (checkout the Icons section before using)

If the chosen defaults don't meet your requirements and you don't want to bloat
your shell configs with aliases, you can use a configuration file instead.
