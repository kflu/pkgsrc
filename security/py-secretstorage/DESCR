This module provides a way for securely storing passwords and other secrets.

It uses D-Bus Secret Service API that is supported by GNOME Keyring
(since version 2.30) and KSecretsService.

SecretStorage supports most of the functions provided by Secret Service,
including creating and deleting items and collections, editing items,
locking and unlocking collections (asynchronous unlocking is also supported).
